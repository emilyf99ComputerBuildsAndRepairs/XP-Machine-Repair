# XP-Machine-Repair
This is a retro-active report as the project was completed a long time ago, therefore images are not accurate of the work undertaken at the time and images of some steps are not included.

I bought this Dell Optiplex at a Carboot around 2018. This was the year I started University and I did not take this project with my to University so it only got completed in 2020.
This machines purpose was to be a Windows XP machine for me to play XP era video games. The reason for this is because newer Operating Systems can have issues running older software.
While I am aware of virtual machines nothing is quite like having the real thing. 

When I test booted this machine I recieved an error regarding the internal clock as well as an overheating issue. I also noted that the machine booted into Ubuntu and the old users data was protected. 
Now I knew the machine booted I took all the components out completely and cleaned the machine thoroughly as this machine was very dusty inside. While all the components were out of the case I inspected them all for quality as well as replacing the original thermal paste. 

I was inspecting for additional dirt build up I may have missed, signs of force damage, smell of burnout and general degrading (such as expanding capacitors). I found that the graphics card was damaged at some point.
The bottom corner of the heatsink looked like it had been pulled off and restuck with something similar to white tac. I removed this component and replaced it as I didn't trust it and suspected that could have caused overheating issues.

Here is the graphics card that I removed, it was replaced with a Geforce 710 1GB Card as that was a modern card with similar specs. This card also has a very small form factor so I knew for sure it would fit. It also had no fan, which in thiscase was a bonuse as the case form factor means that heat could easily be an issue with this machine.

The picture above shows the broken corner on the original Graphics Card. You can see where the previous owner had stuck the corner down.

I replaced the BIOS battery in this machine, this was the source of the clock error and once replaced this error was removed. 

I then wiped the HHD and reinstalled Windows XP onto the drive. I decided to keep the original drive as it outwardly appears to be of good health and I don't plan on storing anything important on this machine so I don't mind the data loss risk.

I then upgraded the RAM in this machine by buying some old stock RAM. However this line of Optiplexs can be funny about RAM upgrades and for some reason this machine would only accept three sticks of the RAM. I rotated the sticks out to see if one of the sticks was damaged but could not find a fault with any of the sticks. Nor was there a fault with the socket as the original RAM the machine came with worked in all the slots.
When trying to use all the sticks of RAM the machine refused to boot and would display a light pattern on the power button. When comparing to the original manual you can use these light flashes to diagnose the problem with your machine. 
I'm not sure why all the RAM would not work in this machine however I did come across some old forum posts detailing other issues people had in the past regarding this machine and RAM speeds as well as specific RAM brands not working.

In the image above is four sticks of RAM. The top orange stick is the replacment RAM and the three sticks below are the old RAM. 

The last thing I attempted was to tidy up the cabling inside the machine. These machines with small form factors can be hard to tidy up due to case room and cable length so I could do very little to neaten up this case.

The above image shows the internals of the XP Machine. 

After an attempt at tidying the cables I was happy with this machine and use it frequently when I feel like playing some XP era PC Games.
